            </div>
            <div class=content>
                    <p>Beats in Bytes is a large-scale study that delves into the under-appreciated field of musicology through programming. Our work utilizes a set of programs that extract numerical data from music (with help from <a href="https://www.humdrum.org/">The Humdrum Toolkit</a>). Using this software, we are able to find trends and patterns that occur in classical music. A large part of our discoveries were the numerical differences that distinguish the music of certain time periods. Our work has continued to develop, and with this website, we aim to provide an intuitive, easy to use analysis platform.</p>

                <h1>What We've Done</h1>
            </div>
            <div class=content>
                <p>In addition to our approachable website and engaging analysis tools, Beats in Bytes has numerous statistical findings documented below, and in our research paper and complete findings booklet.</p>

                        <h2>Laws in Music</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class=subcontentContent>
                        <p>Distribution laws that govern various natural phenomena and human interactions were found by our research to also be in classical music. Benford’s Law was seen in the occurrences of key signatures in classical music, and Zipf’s Law was found in the usage of pitches in Renaissance music.
                        <p>We also found curves in the number of rhythmic themes that are unique to each time period we analyzed. Other things unique to time periods were the number of sequences of notes with repeated pitch or note values, and the number of scales of certain lengths used in songs.
                        A very unique finding was a stepping pattern that occurred when graphing the amount of repetitions of a <i>n</i> note theme versus the length of the theme. 
                        We have no certain explanation for this, which is one of the many topics that have yet to be explored in musical analysis.

                    <div class=subcontentContent>
                        <p>Part of our study was using a comparison algorithm to find patterns in the similarity between songs. You can see comparisons between your song and others by uploading a song and proceeding to the Formula Dashboard.
                        One way to visualize the finding of our algorithm is through a heatmap. This particular heatmap shows the correlations between 25 different composers of our selection, split into 5 time periods.

            </div>
            <div class=content>
                <p>A large part of this project was collecting data in the **kern representation of music. Apart from the <a href=http://kern.ccarh.org>KernScores</a> library, there is very little music encoded like this. There are, however, millions of MIDI and musicXML files available on the internet and we hope to soon have a complete library of converted files. We are in process of creating efficient methods of translating between data formats. </p>
                <p>Lastly, being a musicology project, we are constantly trying to raise public awareness of this fascinating topic, with all of its branches and potential.</p>

                <h1>Future Steps</h1>
            </div>
            <div class=content>
                <p>In the future, we will be creating more code for more analysis. More analysis code that we hope to write and implement include:</p>
                <div class=list>
                    <p>Analysis of chords (progressions, types)</p>
                    <p>Harmonic analysis</p>
                    <p>Dissonance analysis</p>
                    <p>Syncopation</p>
                </div>
                <p>Another thing we have attempted to do is create a ‘universal translator’ between music file formats. We will begin to develop ways to convert text to music, and music to text, as this is a very important stage of analysis.</p>
                <p>A few more tools we want to implement include the following features:</p>
                <div class=list>
                        <p>Analysis of a song by youtube url</p>
                        <p>Prediction of what time period a song is in or best fits a song</p>
                        <p>Recommended songs that are statistically similar to yours</p>
                        <p>Analysis of a song by geography</p>
